 ## Wildlife Image Classification using Deep Learning
This Readme file provides a detailed account of my journey in developing this project.

### Motivation
My deep-rooted fascination for wildlife, fostered by countless hours spent watching National Geographic during my formative years, inspired me to embark on this project.

### Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to address the challenge I faced in identifying various animals encountered during my treks. To overcome this, I leveraged the power of deep learning to create a model capable of recognizing and classifying wildlife species based on uploaded photographs.

### Problem Statement
This project aims to facilitate animal identification during excursions without the need for human intervention, particularly for individuals like me who often encounter unfamiliar wildlife species.

### Key Learnings
This project provided me with valuable insights into the realm of deep learning. Throughout the process, I encountered and overcame challenges related to unwanted images, preprocessing techniques, and model building stages. Additionally, I expanded my skill set by gaining proficiency in CSS and HTML, which allowed me to enhance the project's visual appeal.

### Algorithm Used
After experimenting with several models, I found that the state-of-the-art ResNet50 model offered optimal performance for my use case. I utilized the pre-trained weights of the ResNet50 model, incorporating my own fully connected layer to address the specific requirements of this project.

### Areas for Improvement
While this model serves its purpose, there is room for further enhancement:

Increased Animal Diversity: The model currently incorporates only 20 animal species. Expanding the dataset to include a more comprehensive range of wildlife would significantly improve its capabilities.

Improving Accuracy: Although utilizing ResNet50, the validation accuracy achieved is approximately 80%. Enhancing accuracy can be achieved by augmenting the training dataset and allocating additional computational resources to the model.

Enhanced Styling: The HTML and CSS elements can be further refined to create a more polished and professional user interface.

Moving forward, I am committed to honing my skills and developing more innovative solutions.
