# Wild Life Image Classification using Deep Learning

This Readme file gives the detailed journey of mine in making this 
project.
## Motivation

I used to spend the most of my time watching National Geographic when I was younger, which helped to cultivate a passion for wildlife.



Why this project?

I encountered many animals in the woods while out trekking that I was unable to identify. So I took pictures of them (or at least some of them) and asked my pals to identify the animals' names, but they were unable to.

Years went by until I discovered deep learning, which could address my issue with animal recognition.

I therefore considered creating a deep learning model. Such that my model should have the ability to provide me with the name when I upload a photograph.

## What problem does it solve?

At least for folks like myself, this approach will make it easier to identify animals
 when they are on an excursion without human assistance.
## What did I learn?

This project improved my comprehension of deep learning.

I had numerous issues at every stage, including Unwanted Images, the Pre-processing Stage, and the Model Building Stage,  which made my learning process more challenging.
In the process, I also learned the fundamentals of CSS and HTML, which was very exciting
## Algorithm Used

While training the model, I tried with many models and finally
state of the art model ResNet50 came to my rescue.

I used the weights of the ResNet50 model till the convolutional part 
and then added my own fully connected layer to solve my use case.


## Things Which can be Imporved

This Model is not perfect

 I Included only 20 animals
while building this model which is very far from number of
animals we find in the wild. Well this can be Imporved

I got an validation accuracy of around 80% which is very less
even though I am using ResNet50 , I could have Imporved
the accuracy by giving more images to my model which I was not able to
due to the computational power constraint -- This issue can be solved.

Styling with HTML and CSS can also be Improved, Moving
forward I will be Working hard and create some more amazing things.
